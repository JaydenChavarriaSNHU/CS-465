  Throughout this full stack development project, I gained valuable experience working with different frontend technologies and understanding their unique strengths. The Express HTML templates with Handlebars provided efficient server-side rendering for the public website, while JavaScript added necessary interactivity. The Angular-based SPA for the admin interface delivered a more sophisticated, app-like experience with real-time updates and seamless navigation. On the backend, MongoDB proved to be an excellent choice as our NoSQL database due to its flexibility with unstructured data and natural compatibility with JSON, which served as the crucial bridge between frontend and backend components. JSON's role as a data format, distinct from JavaScript's programming capabilities, enabled smooth data exchange throughout the application.

  The development process involved several instances of code refactoring to improve functionality and efficiency. By creating reusable Angular components for trip management and implementing shared services for authentication and API communication, we significantly reduced code duplication and improved maintainability. Testing played a critical role in ensuring application reliability, particularly when implementing secure endpoints. This involved comprehensive API testing of CRUD operations, authentication flows, and JWT token validation. The layered security approach required careful testing of login processes, protected route access, and error handling to ensure a robust user experience.

  This course has enhanced my professional knowledge, particularly in areas crucial for modern web development. Working with the MEAN stack has given me hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies, while implementing authentication and building secure APIs has deepened my understanding of web security principles. The experience of building both public-facing and administrative interfaces has provided valuable insights into different user needs and how to address them effectively. Although this course doesn't directly apply to any of my future career goals it provides me a perspective into the world of a full stack developer which helps me understand the workload and thought process that the designer/team may go through to create their application/sites.
